# Editor
This is a full-blown IDE work in progress. We're currently building a framework which allows the user to customize the IDE's internal code **within the IDE itself** - allowing creation of new components, layout modification, huge flexibility. The `Component` system creates a tree-like structure of components, layouts stored in JSON files (and component source codes will be in `.java` files in a designated folder).
